# Pixel-Manipulation-for-Image-Encryption


## 📌 Objective
To implement a simple image encryption and decryption system using Python. The encryption is done using a image provided by the user, and the image can later be decrypted.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- User inputs image.
- Encrypts an image pixel-wise using modular arithmetic.
- Decrypts the encrypted image back to the original form.
- Ensures confidentiality of image data.

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

---

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Upload an image to Colab.
2. Run the notebook and upload image.
3. View the encrypted and decrypted images.
